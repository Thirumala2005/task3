Task 3: Linear Regression - AI & ML Internship

Objective

This task aims to implement and understand **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression** using a real-world dataset. The goal is to predict a numerical target variable (e.g., house price) using relevant input features and evaluate the model performance.

Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset used for this task is provided as `data.csv`.

Steps Followed

1. Importing the dataset
2. Preprocessing the data
   - Handling missing values
   - Checking data types
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Building and training a Linear Regression model
5. Predicting results on the test set
6. Evaluating the model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
7. Visualizing:
   - Actual vs Predicted values
   - Regression line (optional)
8. Model Interpretation:
   - Viewing model coefficients and intercept

Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAE    | _to be filled after running code_ |
| MSE    | _to be filled after running code_ |
| R²     | _to be filled after running code_ |
